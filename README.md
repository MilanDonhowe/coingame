# Coin-Game: Centralized Crypto-Currency
Coin-Game is a completely centralized, non-insured, non-legitimate, centralized currency that is NOT on a Blockchain.

Coins have NO real monetary value and cannot be transfered into any form of real or imagined currency.

Coin-Game keeps ZERO history of transactions but rather just executes transactions correctly when they occur.

## How do I generate coins?
- coins get passively generated
- coins can be used to purchase perks

This is a beautiful application powered by:
- very hacked together koa.js backend w/ DOMPurified HTML
- very hacked together frontend using tailwindcss and a little HTMX for spice
- 1 non-backed-up sqlite3 file
